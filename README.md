# Rock Paper Scissors

This is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor REST Countires API challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser
